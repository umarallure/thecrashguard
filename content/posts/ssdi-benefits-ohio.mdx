Applying for SSDI in Ohio takes documentation and patience. Start by collecting medical records, work history, and statements from treating providers. File online at the SSA website or call your local SSA office.

If your claim is denied (common on the first try), consider hiring an experienced SSDI advocate. Ohio has specific forms and medical guidelines — an advocate helps gather the right evidence and prepares you for hearings if needed.

_Short tip: Keep a simple daily log of symptoms and limitations — it’s powerful evidence for your claim._
