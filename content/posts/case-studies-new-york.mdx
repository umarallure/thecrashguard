Case studies and infographics often reveal patterns that help claimants and lawyers evaluate risk. In New York, visual timelines and collision reconstructions can demonstrate fault more clearly than words alone.

Tip: If a crash scene can be captured by photos or video, preserve those images and ask your attorney to include them in a visual timeline — juries and insurers respond well to clear, concise visuals.

This short guide encourages anyone in New York to collect photos, dashcam footage, and witness sketches to strengthen their case.

_Short tip: Keep a simple folder (digital or physical) labeled with the crash date and upload every piece of evidence to it._
