If you suspect medical malpractice in Florida, your first step is to document everything — physician visits, tests, prescriptions, and correspondence. Seek a second medical opinion promptly and preserve medical records.

In Florida, medical negligence cases often require an expert medical opinion to establish the standard of care. Consult with an attorney experienced in medical malpractice to determine whether you have a valid claim.

_Short tip: Request copies of your medical records right away so your attorney can review them._
