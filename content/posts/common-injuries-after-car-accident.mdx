Common injuries include whiplash, concussions, soft-tissue strain, broken bones, and back injuries. Each injury has a different medical course and cost, which affects settlement calculations.

- Whiplash and soft-tissue injuries often rely on medical documentation to show persistent symptoms.
- Traumatic brain injuries (even mild) can dramatically increase damages.
- Broken bones with surgery or long recovery times generally increase settlement value.

Short tip: Medically document your injuries quickly — insurers often devalue claims without clear medical records.
