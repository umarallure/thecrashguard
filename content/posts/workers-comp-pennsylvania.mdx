If you’re injured on the job in Pennsylvania, notify your employer as soon as possible. Seek medical attention and follow the employer’s reporting procedures.

You may be entitled to wage replacement and medical benefits under Pennsylvania’s workers' compensation system. Keep records of doctor visits, time off work, and employer communication.

Consider consulting a workers' compensation attorney if your employer denies the claim or you have a complicated injury.

_Short tip: File your incident report immediately and request a copy for your records._
