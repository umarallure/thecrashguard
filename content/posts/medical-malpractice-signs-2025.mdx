Medical malpractice often depends on a clear deviation from the standard of care. Look for missed diagnoses, surgical errors, medication mistakes, and failure to obtain informed consent.

Steps to take: Collect medical records, timelines, and expert reviews promptly. Insurance companies and medical providers may be defensive — protect your documentation.

Short tip: Medical records plus an independent expert review give your attorney the strongest chance at proving negligence.
