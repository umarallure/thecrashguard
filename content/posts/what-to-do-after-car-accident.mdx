# What to Do After a Car Accident: A Complete Guide

Being involved in a car accident can be a traumatic and confusing experience. Knowing the right steps to take immediately after an accident can protect your legal rights and help ensure you receive fair compensation for your injuries and damages.

## Immediate Steps at the Accident Scene

### 1. Ensure Safety First

Your health and safety should be your top priority. If anyone is injured, call 911 immediately. If the accident is minor and vehicles are drivable, move them to a safe location away from traffic.

**Key Actions:**
- Check yourself and passengers for injuries
- Turn on hazard lights
- Set up warning triangles or flares if available
- Do not leave the scene

### 2. Call the Police

Always call the police, even for minor accidents. A police report creates an official record of the incident, which is crucial for insurance claims and potential legal action.

**What to Tell the Police:**
- Exact location of the accident
- Number of vehicles involved
- Any visible injuries
- Traffic conditions and weather

### 3. Document Everything

Thorough documentation is essential for building a strong case. Use your smartphone to capture evidence while it's fresh.

**What to Document:**
- Photos of all vehicles from multiple angles
- Damage to your vehicle and other vehicles
- License plates
- Street signs and traffic signals
- Road conditions
- Weather conditions
- Any visible injuries
- Skid marks or debris

## Exchange Information

Collect essential information from all parties involved, but keep conversations minimal. Never admit fault or apologize, as this can be used against you later.

**Information to Gather:**
- Full names and contact information
- Insurance company names and policy numbers
- Driver's license numbers
- Vehicle make, model, and license plate
- Contact information for witnesses

## Seek Medical Attention

Even if you feel fine, see a doctor as soon as possible. Some injuries, like whiplash or internal injuries, may not show symptoms immediately.

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates a medical record linking injuries to the accident
- Identifies hidden injuries early
- Strengthens your insurance claim
- Protects your health long-term

## Report to Your Insurance Company

Contact your insurance company promptly, but be cautious about what you say. Stick to the basic facts and avoid speculating about fault or the extent of injuries.

**What to Report:**
- Date, time, and location of accident
- Basic facts of what happened
- Other parties involved
- Police report number

## Do NOT Do These Things

Avoid these common mistakes that can harm your case:

- **Don't admit fault** - Even saying "I'm sorry" can be interpreted as an admission
- **Don't sign anything** from the other driver's insurance without consulting a lawyer
- **Don't give recorded statements** to other insurance companies
- **Don't post on social media** about the accident
- **Don't accept the first settlement offer** - It's often lower than what you deserve

## When to Hire a Lawyer

Consider hiring a personal injury lawyer if:

- You suffered serious injuries
- Fault is disputed
- Multiple parties are involved
- The insurance company denies your claim
- You're offered a settlement that seems too low
- The accident involved a commercial vehicle

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do I have to file a claim?

The statute of limitations for personal injury claims varies by state, typically ranging from 1-6 years. However, it's best to act quickly while evidence is fresh.

### What if the other driver doesn't have insurance?

If you have uninsured motorist coverage, your own insurance may cover your damages. A lawyer can help you explore all available options.

### Can I still get compensation if I was partially at fault?

In many states, you can still recover damages even if you were partially at fault, though your compensation may be reduced by your percentage of fault.
