Car accidents in California can be stressful and costly. Take a deep breath and focus on safety first. If anyone is injured, call 911 right away. Move to a safe area if possible and turn on your hazard lights.

Document the scene — take photos of vehicle damage, license plates, and road conditions. Exchange information with the other driver and gather witness contacts. In California's comparative fault system, partial responsibility does not always block recovery, so avoid admitting fault.

After leaving the scene, seek medical attention even if you feel fine; some injuries appear later. Report the crash to your insurer and consult a personal injury lawyer if you have serious injuries or the other party disputes fault.

Stay organized — keep repair estimates, medical bills, and photos together to build a strong claim.

_Short tip: If possible, write down events leading up to the accident as soon as they’re fresh in your memory._
