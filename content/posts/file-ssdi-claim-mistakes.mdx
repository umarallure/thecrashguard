Filing for SSDI requires comprehensive medical records, detailed work histories, and evidence of functional limitation. Common mistakes include missing records, incomplete work history, and not following prescribed treatments.

What to do: Compile medical statements from providers, keep a symptom diary, and respond to SSA requests promptly. Consider an advocate if your claim is complex.

Short tip: Start early — gather all docs before filing to reduce delays and avoid denials.
