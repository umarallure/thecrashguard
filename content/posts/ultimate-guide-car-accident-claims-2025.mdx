Navigating a car accident claim can be confusing — especially with changing laws and insurer tactics. This guide outlines immediate steps to protect your claim, evidence you must preserve, and a timeline for what to expect from filing through resolution.

Key points:
- Collect photos, witness info, and the police report.
- Seek medical attention and document every visit and expense.
- Don’t sign releases or recorded statements without consulting counsel.
- Know your state’s statute of limitations and reporting deadlines.

Short tip: Create a single digital folder (photos, receipts, medical records) so everything’s organized when you talk to an attorney or adjuster.
