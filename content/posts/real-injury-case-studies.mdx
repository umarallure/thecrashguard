A few well-managed cases illustrate how evidence, expert testimony, and thoughtful negotiation lead to larger awards. In New York, juries often respond strongly to medical timelines, demonstrable negligence, and impactful visual aids.

What worked:
- Early expert medical testimony establishing causation.
- Strong photo/video evidence of scene and injuries.
- A persuasive chronology of medical treatment showing long-term impact.

Short tip: Keep a daily journal of pain, limitations, and treatment — it’s valuable evidence when combined with expert testimony.
